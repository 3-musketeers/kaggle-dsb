4. Data
   1. competition data
   2. luna16 data


## Issues
* What if the data cannot fit on the computer?
  * competition data- experiment with the sample

### Data issue 
(so how are we going to make use of AWS, and what is the workflow going to look like? are you going to download all the data to your computer? is it worth it? or do you just need sample datasets? and you run the stuff for all of the dataset on the cloud?)

#### 1 option
1. Use sample datasets to make the code, and make sure it works for all of the data
2. port the code over to AWS, where the entire dataset is stored and run the code for the entire dataset

#### Questions
1. is it fast enough to run the model on the laptop alone? (so you don't need instances?)
2. can you really just use a sample dataset to make all the code, or do you need to be experimenting with all the code?
