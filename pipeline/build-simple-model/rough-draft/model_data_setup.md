# Basic Model Data Setup Instructions
*how to setup the data for this basic model*

## Instructions:
1. Download all data to the 4TB hard drive
2. Check if it takes a large amount of time to read over data from the hard drive
3. If it does not take a large amount of time:
   * Take subsets of the entire dsb/luna16 datasets as you sample sets of data
4. If it does take a large amount of time:
   * Copy over subsets of the entire dsb/luna16 datasets to your local drive 
   * Use the local drive subsets as your sample sets of data

## Notes:
**Torrents:**
> In the BitTorrent file distribution system, a torrent file is a computer file that contains metadata about files and folders to be distributed, and usually also a list of the network locations of trackers, which are computers that help participants in the system find each other and form efficient distribution groups called swarms.

**Is bit torrent safe?**:
> It should be as it is offered as an option for both competitions.

**What is the safest torrent client?**
> Gonna stick with Bittorrent's supported client [here](http://www.bittorrent.com/).


## 4TB External Drive
Contains the entire kaggle dataset, as well as the entire luna16 dataset.

## Local Drive
Contains samples of the kaggle dataset and the luna16 dataset, if it takes too long to read from the external hard drive.
