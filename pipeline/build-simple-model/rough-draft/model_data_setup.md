# Basic Model Data Setup Instructions
*how to setup the data for this basic model*

## Instructions:
1. Download all data to the 4TB hard drive
2. Check if it takes a large amount of time to read over data from the hard drive
3. If it does not take a large amount of time:
   * Take subsets of the entire dsb/luna16 datasets as you sample sets of data
4. If it does take a large amount of time:
   * Copy over subsets of the entire dsb/luna16 datasets to your local drive 
   * Use the local drive subsets as your sample sets of data


## 4TB External Drive
Contains the entire kaggle dataset, as well as the entire luna16 dataset.

## Local Drive
Contains samples of the kaggle dataset and the luna16 dataset, if it takes too long to read from the external hard drive.
