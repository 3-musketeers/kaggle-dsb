    "- *A ConvNet architecture is in the simplest case a list of Layers that transform the image volume into an output volume*\n",
    "- Neural network where connectivity pattern between neurons is inspired by organization of animal visual cortex (perfect for image recognition)\n",
    "- Individual cortical neurons respond to stimuli in a restricted region of space known as the receptive field. The receptive fields of different neurons partially overlap such that they tile the visual field. The response of an individual neuron to stimuli within its receptive field can be approximated mathematically by a convolution operation\n",
    "  - receptive fields: small neuron collections which process portions of the input image, outputs of those neurons are tiled so input regions overlap (repeated for every layer of the network)\n",
    "  - pooling layers: combine the outputs of neuron clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features:\n",
    "1. 3D Volumes of Neurons: \n",
    "   - layers of neurons in 3 dimensions (length, height, depth)\n",
    "   - one layer only connected to small region in layer before it (receptive field)\n",
    "   - distinct layers (locally/completely connected) are stacked\n",
    "2. Local Connectivity:\n",
    "   - spatially local connectivity between neurons (in adjacent layers)\n",
    "   - filters are built for local input patterns\n",
    "   - stacking many \"local layers\" creates global filters (response to larger region)\n",
    "   - first network creates representations of small parts of input, then larger areas\n",
    "3. Shared Weights:\n",
    "   - filter is replicated across entire visual field (same weight/bias)\n",
    "   - all neurons in one layer detect same feature (you can detect features regarless of position in visual field)\n",
    "   - allows you to find statistical invariants easily, you can detect a feature anywhere in the image\n",
    "   - **only use if one feature is useful to compute at some spatial position (x,y), then it should also be useful to compute at a different position (x2,y2)**\n",
    "4. Convolution:\n",
    "   - if all neurons are using the same weight vector, then forward pass can be computed as a convolution (of weights and inputs)\n",
    "   - kernel / filter: commonly used to refer to sets of weights (because it is convolved with input)\n",

    "3. feature map / filters: every single layer in the depth dimension\n",
    "4. stride: number of pixels shifting by for each filter\n",
    "5. 'valid' padding: no padding, the next layer of neurons does not reach past the edge of image\n",
    "6. 'same' padding: pad with 0s, go off the edge so next layer of neurons is same size as previous\n",
    "7. receptive field / filter size: spatial extent of connectivity from neurons in one layer to the other\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parts of CNN:\n",
    "1. Convolutional Layer\n",
    "   - layer's parameters: of a set of learnable filters (kernels), with small receptive field (going through the depth of the input volume)\n",
    "   - network learning: learns filters that activate when detecting specific feature\n",

    "     - receptive field hyperparameter: determines how big the patches are\n",
    "2. Pooling Layer\n",
    "   - reduce spatial extent of image (length, height), without losing too much information like the strides from convolutional layer (controls overfitting)\n",
    "   - max pooling: take the max in the region to downsample (no parameters, accurate, only pooling size and stride)\n",
    "   - average pooling: take average over window of pixels at location (basically a blurred, low resolution view of the image)\n",
    "3. 1x1 Convolutions\n",

    "4. Inception Module\n",
    "   - choosing between using pooling, 5x5, 3x3, 1x1 convolutions (when all of them could help you with your modeling so why choose? USE THEM ALL)\n",
    "   - do all of the different possibilities in different locations, with different orders and concatenate their outputs\n",
    "   - choose less parameters in a way that it is better than simple convolution!\n",

    "### Understanding Activation Functions\n",
    "**What is an activation function?** ~ Activation functions (in terms of neural networks), are functions that can be applied to every individual neuron. So after the neuron takes in inputs, multiplies times weights and adds, it takes its value and feeds it to an activation function. Every neuron in the network has an activation function. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why have an activation function?** ~ A neural network with no activation functions will simply be a single linear neuron. Therefore it cannot separate nonlinear cases (its just a linear boundary!). Thus without activation function you cannot have non linear functions, imagine trying to model everything in life with a line! (read [here](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-role-of-the-activation-function-in-a-neural-network) and [here](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-neural-networks-need-an-activation-function))\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation for ReLU and Sigmoid** ~ IF you think about neuron action potential, the neuron needs to pass a certain threshold or else it does not fire. ReLu function's output is either 0 or positive, so if a neuron with ReLU is 0, it is \"off\" and its inputs are not propogated forward. However if the neuron is on, its input is sent to next layers. Basically it mimics the action potential of a neuron (without it, you would not have thresholds and it would all be linear). Sigmoid is similar except for the fact it limits solely to between 0 or 1 (very small or very large = very close to the 1 or 0).
