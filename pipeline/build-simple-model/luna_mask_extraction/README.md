# Luna Mask Extraction
*goal: from the luna dataset, extract the masks for each img, where the mask overlaid on top of the image yields the nodule*

## Files:
* final.py -- contains the final copy code (able to be run with 16GB RAM limitations)
* sandbox.ipynb -- contains the experimentation with the code for final.py
